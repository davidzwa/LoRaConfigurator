Device A2 was flashed source
Device A0 was receiver

Did not save flash blob of 200f_14g, instead I exported it from STM32Programmer (64kB was sufficient).
rlnc_200f_10b_fake_14g_15r_1409709959rng_notused.bin is therefore marked `_notused`

Observations:
11/04 I notice bad performance for 10g, also I see that beyond PER 0.5 there is almost no use in measuring
